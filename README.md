# Problem

# Create a program that will allow you to select and play a game of Rock Paper Scissors. And for it to only be a first to 5.

# Process
# 1. Using HTML and CSS to make the basic bones of the project. With CSS, make an easy to see visualizer for the code implemented.
# 2. Create the code using minimal Javascript
# 3. Learn and implement arrow functions, switches, and DOM manipulation through scrpit.
# 4. Googling

# What I learned
# How to work smarter and not harder with code. I initially started the code with logical or and and statements to set the entire project up. But I confused myself with variables and console logs. I did not know the next step to visually show the user that they are actually doing something. I restarted and learned that you need to sometimes see exactly what is happening, because if it is all going on in the background, you'll never know the problem. 

# In order to do that I create the basic HTML layout for the page, then I styled it in CSS to let me see in the live replay the element I was letting my code know what to do. After this, I started my code; first I set a var for the scores, then the first thing I did was make a function to end the game. this function only disables to buttons and will be called on once the time comes.

# next I made the update score function. this function uses the const set for the choices and convert them into numbers to do an equation to selection the winner and lose based off the number from the difference and not an if, else if, else, for all the different options. this is where I learned switches which allowed for this process to be streamlined.
